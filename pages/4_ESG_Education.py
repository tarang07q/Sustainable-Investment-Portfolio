    ESG ratings are assessments of a company's exposure to ESG risks and its management of those risks
    relative to industry peers. These ratings are provided by specialized agencies that analyze various
    data points from company disclosures, public sources, and proprietary research.

    **Key ESG rating providers include:**
    - MSCI ESG Ratings
    - Sustainalytics
    - S&P Global ESG Scores
    - Bloomberg ESG Disclosure Scores
    - ISS ESG Corporate Rating

    **Challenges with ESG ratings:**
    - Lack of standardization across rating providers
    - Data quality and availability issues
    - Different methodologies and weightings
    - Focus on risk rather than impact

    It's important to understand the methodology behind ESG ratings and use multiple sources when
    evaluating a company's ESG performance.

# ML Models for Sustainable Investment Portfolio

This repository contains the machine learning models and datasets for the Sustainable Investment Portfolio application. These models provide AI-powered recommendations, risk assessment, and sentiment analysis.

## Files Included

1. **Dataset Generation**:
   - `large_portfolio_dataset.py`: Script to generate a large portfolio dataset
   - `market_news_generator.py`: Script to generate market news data

2. **ML Models**:
   - `portfolio_recommendation_model.py`: Portfolio recommendation model
   - `risk_assessment_model.py`: Risk assessment model
   - `sentiment_analysis_model.py`: Sentiment analysis model

3. **Google Colab Notebook**:
   - `ML_Models_for_Portfolio_Recommendations.ipynb`: Notebook to run and demonstrate the ML models

## How to Run in Google Colab

Follow these steps to run the ML models in Google Colab:

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Click on "File" > "Upload notebook"
   - Upload the `ML_Models_for_Portfolio_Recommendations.ipynb` file

2. **Upload Python Scripts**:
   - When prompted in the notebook, upload the following Python scripts:
     - `large_portfolio_dataset.py`
     - `market_news_generator.py`
     - `portfolio_recommendation_model.py`
     - `risk_assessment_model.py`
     - `sentiment_analysis_model.py`

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Click "Runtime" > "Run all" to execute all cells in the notebook
   - Alternatively, you can run each cell individually by clicking the play button next to each cell

4. **Generate Sample Output (Optional)**:
   - Upload the `generate_sample_output.py` script
   - Run it to generate comprehensive sample outputs including:
     - Portfolio recommendations based on the dataset
     - Risk assessment with detailed factor breakdown
     - Sentiment analysis with visualizations
     - A complete summary report in text format

## What the Models Do

### 1. Portfolio Recommendation Model

The portfolio recommendation model uses a gradient boosting regressor to analyze assets based on:
- ESG scores (environmental, social, governance)
- Financial metrics (ROI, volatility, market cap)
- Market trends
- User preferences

The model provides personalized investment recommendations that balance financial returns with sustainability goals.

### 2. Risk Assessment Model

The risk assessment model uses a random forest classifier to evaluate portfolio risk based on:
- Portfolio volatility
- Beta and market correlation
- Sharpe ratio
- ESG risk factors
- Sector volatility
- Liquidity metrics

The model categorizes risk into four levels (Low, Moderate, High, Very High) and provides detailed risk factor analysis.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Model

The sentiment analysis model uses natural language processing techniques to analyze market sentiment from news articles. It:
- Processes text data using TF-IDF vectorization
- Classifies sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative
- Calculates an overall sentiment score
- Provides trading implications based on sentiment analysis

## Visualizations

The notebook generates several visualizations to help understand the ML models:

- Feature importance plots
- Top recommendations chart
- Risk factor breakdown
- Risk gauge
- Sentiment distribution
- Word clouds for different sentiment categories
- Sentiment gauge

## Customization

You can customize the models by:

1. **Adjusting User Preferences**:
   - Modify the `user_preferences` dictionary to change risk tolerance and sustainability focus

2. **Changing Portfolio Composition**:
   - Select different assets for the sample portfolio

3. **Modifying Model Parameters**:
   - Adjust hyperparameters in the model classes to change model behavior

## Presentation Tips

When presenting to your review panel:

1. **Highlight the ML Features**:
   - Show the visualizations generated by the models
   - Explain how the models make decisions based on the data

2. **Explain the Technical Implementation**:
   - Discuss the algorithms used (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
   - Explain the feature engineering and data preprocessing

3. **Demonstrate Real-Time Analysis**:
   - Show how changing user preferences affects recommendations
   - Analyze sentiment for different tickers

4. **Discuss Future Enhancements**:
   - Mention potential improvements like deep learning models
   - Discuss integration with real-time market data

## Requirements

The notebook requires the following Python packages:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib
- wordcloud

These will be installed automatically when you run the notebook in Google Colab.
